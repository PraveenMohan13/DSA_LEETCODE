_____________________________________________________________________________
Practice Order Recommendation
1. Start with classic 0/1 subset problems (416, 494).
2. Move to coin change & knapsack variants (518, 322).
3. Practice constrained or 2D knapsack (474, 879).
4. Finish with creative or hybrid subset problems (1774, 1981).
